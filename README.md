# MDP Simulator
An Markov Decision Process simulator was a mini project of my AI coursework at KMUTT.
The application was designed to runable on most modern web browsers without any installation.

You can play the demo at https://www.spicydog.org/projects/mdp-simulator/.

Feel free to do whatever you want and sorry for bad coding style since I was too busy at the moment.
